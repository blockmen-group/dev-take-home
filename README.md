# Full Stack Dev Take Home

Estimated time:
Don't spend more than 5 hours on this, but take a few days to do some research

## Provided Resources
- [ ] Requirements Markdown (this file)
- [ ] A small number of venues in data.json
- [ ] A screenshot of expected venue cards
- [ ] A screenshot of expected individual venue page


## Overview
- [ ] Create a Monorepo using Turborepo
- [ ] Add a Nextjs application to the monorepo
- [ ] Add 2-3 packages that will be used by the Nextjs app
- [ ] Create 2 pages in Nextjs
	- [ ] Page for displaying multiple venue cards
 	- [ ] Each venue card is a link to the individual venue page
	- [ ] Individual venue page displaying data about the one venue
- [ ] Create a GET API that returns all venues and a GET API for individual venue
- [ ] Create a light automation test
	- [ ] Use Playwright or Cypress or Puppeteer, just needs to be Javascript based and run within the respository
	- [ ] Validate that the venues page loads and you can click on a card, it takes you to the new route that is the one venue

**Bonus Points (absolutely not a requirement):**
Graphql Implementation
React Relay implementation
Unit tests with Vite or Jest
Github Action that kicks off test suites

### Notes: 
If you use the right tools, this sort of thing should really only take a few hours to wire up so feel free to get creative here. My main concern that I want to see is how you work with the packages in the monorepo and how you'd set up the testing architecture. 

Do not focus on styling, strongly encourage you using an existing Design System for this project.

Take a few days to work through this. Like I mentioned, the right tools here will make this project feel way simpler than it looks. Do some research, take note of some of the things you've found, and choose the paths that make the most sense for you. 

Feel free to use LLM's, we are not docking points for using them, but make sure you understand what they're providing you and be able to explain the parts that they helped you with. We are big supporters and users of Cursor so we just want to see how you interact with them. If you do use the LLM's, just make note of where in the project you got help from them
