# Full Stack Dev Take Home

Estimated time:
Don't spend more than 5 hours on this, but take a few days to do some research
#### Overview
- [ ] Create a Monorepo using Turborepo
- [ ] Add a Nextjs application to the monorepo
- [ ] Add 2-3 packages that will be used by the Nextjs app
- [ ] Create 3 pages in Nextjs
	- [ ] Home page
	- [ ] Route for multiple venues
	- [ ]  Individual venue page
- [ ]  Create an API for all venues and an individual venue
- [ ] Create a light automation test
	- [ ] Use Playwright or Cypress or Puppeteer, just needs to be Javascript based
	- [ ] Validate that the home page loads and you can click on a button to take you to a route

Bonus Points (absolutely not a requirement):
Graphql Implementation
React Relay implementation
Unit tests
Github Action that kicks off test suites

Notes: 
If you use the right tools this sort of thing should really only take a few hours to wire up so feel free to get creative here. My main concern that I want to see is how you work with the packages in the monorepo and how you'd set up the testing architecture. 

Do not focus on styling, strongly encourage you using an existing Design System for this project.

Take a few days to work through this. Like I mentioned, the right tools here will make this project feel way simpler than it looks. Do some research, take note of some of the things you've found, and choose the paths that make the most sense for you.
